            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE Of the Antient Free CARMEN of <hi>London,</hi> Humbly offer'd to the Consideration of the Honourable <hi>House of Commons.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Carmen</hi> of <hi>London</hi> were made a Fellowship by the City in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII and in the Third Year of King <hi>James</hi> I. were Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the People call'd <hi>Fuellers,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Wood mongers,</hi> and so continued till the Year 1668. about which time several Complaints being made to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. by divers great Personages, of the <hi>Woodmongers</hi> Frauds in buying and selling of <hi>Sea-Coal</hi> and other Fuel, His Majesty recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Redress thereof to the City of <hi>London;</hi> upon which a Committee of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council</hi> was chosen, who reported their Frauds and Abuses in the <hi>Measure</hi> of their <hi>Fuel;</hi> and amongst divers other Matters, <hi>That no effectual Course could be taken for Redressing thereof, but by Prohibiting the</hi> Woodmongers <hi>from keeping and working</hi> Carts <hi>of their own, for carrying abroad</hi> their Fuel: Upon which Report the Court of <hi>Common-Council</hi> passed an Act to effect the same, <hi>Anno</hi> 1665.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Woodmongers</hi> still continuing their evil Practices, particularly their grand abuses done to the <hi>Carmen,</hi> application was made to the King in Council for the <hi>Carmens</hi> Relief; upon which the <hi>Woodmongers</hi> Appealed to the Parliament, where their Abuses were made so apparent, that, for fear of Prosecution and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, they surrendred their <hi>Charter:</hi> And hereupon the <hi>Carmen</hi> were made a Fellowship by the City, by the Name of <hi>The Free Carmen of</hi> London, <hi>Anno</hi> 1668.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Woodmongers</hi> contemning the aforemention'd Act of <hi>Common-Council,</hi> several Suits were brought against them for Working unlicensed Carts; and the Act being found to be deficient in matter of Form, upon argument in the Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Judges gave particular Directions how it should be amended; which the <hi>Common-Council</hi> having done, it was by them passed into an Act, in the Year 1681. and the <hi>Woodmongers</hi> still refusing to conform, Actions were brought against them in <hi>London;</hi> which they removed into the Courts of <hi>Common Pleas</hi> and <hi>Exchequer;</hi> where the validity of the Act was argu'd by Council learned, and the Honorable the Judges of both Courts, pronounc'd the said Act to be a <hi>good By-Law,</hi> and granted <hi>Procedendoes</hi> therupon.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Woodmongers</hi> finding the said By-Law to be binding, did apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the City, and by their crafty Insinuations, have obtain'd an Act of <hi>Common-Council,</hi> for allowing them 120 Carts, over and above the 420 old Licensed Carts, which they now work: so that near 200 old Licensed Carts stand Idle daily for want of their rightful Labour, to the impoverishing and undoing several Hundreds of the antient <hi>Free Carmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now may it further be offer'd to your Considerations, that</hi> WE <hi>the said poor</hi> Carmen <hi>of</hi> London, <hi>have paid time out of mind near</hi> 400 l. <hi>a year, for the Relief of the poor Children of</hi> Christ's Hospital, <hi>and tho' we are now opprest by the new Addition of</hi> 120. <hi>over and above the antient number of</hi> 420. <hi>yet we continue to pay it still, to the impoverishing our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that the said antient</hi> Carmen, <hi>do not desire to lessen the Authority the City and Liberties of</hi> London <hi>and the</hi> Hospital <hi>ought of right to have over them, but to Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the Number of</hi> 420, <hi>those being a sufficient Number to perform all the Services of the City: Which will also prevent the usual Frauds and Deceits of the</hi> Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers <hi>as hath been often proved against them. And we the said poor</hi> Car-men <hi>are willing also to pay to</hi> Greenwich Hospital 300 l. per annum, <hi>for and towards the support of the Wounded, Antient and Indigent Seamen.</hi>
